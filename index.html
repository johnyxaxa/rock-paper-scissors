<!--Rules of the Game-->

<!-- A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: 
    a draw, a win or a loss. 
    A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who 
    has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[1]), 
    but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
    a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). 
    If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie. -->
